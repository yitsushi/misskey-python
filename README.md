# [WIP] Misskey Python Client

Note that WIP, it may change it's structure, it's not even a "package" yet.

The main purpose is debugging and accessing services that I can not access from
the v12.x UI or easier to manage it from cli for me.

I'm not even sure if it will be a package at any time, maybe it will be only
a simple management tool, but most likely it will be a full-featured package
that everyone can use in their applications.


All work based on: https://misskey.io/api-doc
